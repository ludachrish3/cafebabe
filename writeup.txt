   Our SPIMbot, CAFEBABE, was named after the regularly-appearing hexadecimal number of the same title. We completed our project by using the given solution code from previous labs, but with some slight modifications in order to have our SPIMbot function correctly. We decided to use the fast version of the puzzle solve code since the goal of the competition is to make as much progress as possible within a set number of cycles. 
   One modification we made to the solution code was to have CAFEBABE leave its current planet for another after a positive, nonzero favor value was reached. The original code only branched after a favor of 10 was reached simply because a favor of 10+ was the requirement for that particular lab. By branching after 1 (or higher), we would now be able to visit and work with other planets faster while still leaving a positive value. Aside from that, we also wrote additional code in order to ensure that CAFEBABE visited other planets as well, since the original did not do so.
